# Heartrate_fusion
A fusion method trial for heartrate detection from ECG and PPG signals.
The project is done as an assignment for the course mathematics for research.

The work focuses on training SVMs for heartbeat detection on ECG and PPG signals, from which heartrate is extracted.
The heartrates from these two sources are fused based on their signal quality values.
The notebook illustrates the work with one recording of ECG and PPG signals. The method has not been verified or tested on a large dataset.
